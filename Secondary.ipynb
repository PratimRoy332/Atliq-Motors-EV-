    "FAME II Scheme\n",
    "The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME II) scheme is a flagship program of the government that aims to promote the adoption of EVs in the country. Under this scheme, the government provides financial incentives to buyers of EVs, which reduces the upfront cost of purchasing an EV. This scheme has played a significant role in increasing the demand for EVs, which, in turn, has led to an increase in the number of EV financing options available in the market.\n",

    "GST Reduction\n",
    "The Goods and Services Tax (GST) on EVs was reduced from 12% to 5% in 2019 to encourage the adoption of EVs. This reduction in GST has made EVs more affordable, which has led to an increase in the demand for EVs. This increase in demand has led to more financing options being available for EV buyers, including innovative financing models such as battery leasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsidies for EV Charging Infrastructure\n",
    "The government has also announced subsidies for EV charging infrastructure to promote the adoption of EVs. Under this scheme, the government provides financial incentives to individuals and companies for setting up EV charging stations. This has led to an increase in the availability of charging infrastructure, which has increased the demand for EVs. This increase in demand has led to more financing options being available for EV buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "State-Level Incentives\n",
    "Several states in India have announced their own incentives for EVs. For example, Maharashtra offers a subsidy of up to Rs. 5,000 per kWh of battery capacity for EVs. Similarly, Delhi offers a 100% waiver on road tax for EVs. These state-level incentives have played a significant role in promoting the adoption of EVs in their respective states, which has led to an increase in the demand for EV financing options.\n"
